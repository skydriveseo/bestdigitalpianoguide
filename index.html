					<p>Yamaha P71 is a great digital piano for beginners. It features a full-size weighted keyboard with 88 keys, so you can play the piano like a pro. The P71 is equipped with the famous Yamaha graded hammer action II (GH2) keyboard, which offers natural resistance and response, meaning that you can create different tones depending on how hard or soft you press the keys down. This feature makes it easier to play complex compositions and songs by adding dynamics to your playing style.</p>
					<p>Yamaha P71 has a sleek look, with an elegant design and a futuristic design. The piano comes in two different color options: black and white. Both of them look great, but the white one looks more attractive.</p>

You can choose from 100 rhythms and 50 song accompaniments to suit your style of music. Yamaha P71 has 4 built-in speakers which deliver rich sound quality no matter what you play on the keyboard without any distortion or noise at all, unlike other budget keyboards where there are no built-in speakers at all!</p>
					<p>The Yamaha Education Suite provides interactive lessons for learning how to play the piano or improve your skills at an advanced level. This feature is especially useful for beginners who want to learn how to play their favorite songs from popular artists or add some new twists to old classics.</p>

					<p>Yamaha P71 has 128-note polyphony which means it can handle multiple notes at once without any distortion in sound quality. This allows you to play chords or arpeggios without any issues.</p>
					<p>The Yamaha P71 also includes a USB port that allows you to connect it directly to your computer and import audio files into the internal memory of your digital piano so they can be played back when needed! This is great news for anyone who wants to learn how to compose their own music or record their own progressions as they progress through their studies.</p>
					<p>Additionally, there's an audio input jack so you can connect other devices such as MP3 players or CD players for playing along with your favorite songs or backing tracks.</p>
					<p>As Yamaha P71 comes with weighted keys, it means that they feel more realistic and natural than other digital pianos in this price range do. The keyboard is also fully touch-sensitive, so you can play with different dynamics and styles of music. The keys have been designed specifically to simulate real piano keys as closely as possible so that you can get more comfortable while playing music on them, whether they are acoustic or electric instruments.</p>
